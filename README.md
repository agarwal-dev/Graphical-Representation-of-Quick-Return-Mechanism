# Quick Return Mechanism – Graphical Representation

This project features a functional CAD model of a slotted lever crank quick return mechanism, developed as part of a group project in May 2025. The model is designed to graphically represent the displacement-time behavior of the slider and provide an approximate velocity profile throughout its motion cycle.

## Project Overview

The quick return mechanism is widely used in shaping machines to achieve a faster return stroke. This CAD model demonstrates the practical working of the mechanism while also serving as a tool to visualize the displacement and approximate velocity of the slider during operation.

## Key Features

- Mechanism based on the slotted lever crank quick return principle
- Functional CAD assembly capable of simulating slider motion
- Displacement-time plotting capability for visual analysis
- Designed for both demonstration and educational purposes
- Multiple iterations were implemented to optimize performance and clarity

## Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience in mechanical design and CAD modeling
- Application of kinematic theory in a physical prototype
- Understanding of quick return dynamics and motion simulation

## Tools Used

- SolidWorks 2023  
- Assembly and Simulation Modules  

## Files Included

- `.SLDPRT` – Individual parts of the mechanism  
- `.SLDASM` – Complete working assembly  
- Rendered images and animation files
